#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

##Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Spftware engineering is the process of developing software that is simple and easy to use.It's importance in the technology industry include:
Systematic Development: Software engineering provides structured processes and methodologies to ensure that software development is systematic and organized, from planning and designing to testing and deployment. This helps teams deliver high-quality software that meets user needs and performs reliably.

Quality Assurance: By following engineering principles, software engineers can better ensure the reliability, performance, and security of applications. This minimizes bugs and other issues, resulting in more stable and user-friendly products.

Efficiency and Productivity: Software engineering techniques and tools, like version control, continuous integration, and modular programming, enable development teams to work more efficiently, collaborate more effectively, and automate repetitive tasks.

##Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): Structured programming marked a shift away from "spaghetti code" and promoted writing code with clear, logical control structures (like loops and conditionals). This approach, led by figures like Edsger Dijkstra, improved readability and maintainability, laying the foundation for organized software development.

The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced the concepts of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, enabling developers to model real-world entities in code. This milestone transformed how software was designed and managed, allowing for greater code reuse and modularity, and facilitating large-scale software projects.

The Rise of Agile and DevOps (2000s-present): Agile methodologies emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development, breaking away from rigid, lengthy processes. Later, DevOps further bridged development and operations, enabling continuous integration, deployment, and automation. Together, these approaches revolutionized software delivery by making it faster, more responsive to change, and more aligned with user needs.

##List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: The initial phase involves defining project goals, scope, and requirements. It includes resource allocation, timeline estimation, and setting the budget, helping ensure the project aligns with business objectives.

Requirements Analysis: This phase gathers detailed functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. It results in a clear understanding of what the software must achieve, guiding the design and development phases.

Design: Based on the requirements, a system architecture is created. This stage includes both high-level design (defining modules, data flow, etc.) and detailed design (specifying components, interfaces, etc.), which acts as a blueprint for development.

Implementation (Coding): Developers write the actual code based on the design documents. They create the software components, integrate them, and follow coding standards, ensuring the product aligns with the design.

Testing: Testing verifies that the software meets all requirements and functions correctly. Different testing types (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) help identify and resolve bugs or issues.

Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to a live environment. It might be a full launch or a gradual rollout, depending on the project strategy.

Maintenance: After deployment, the software is maintained to fix bugs, update features, and improve performance as user needs evolve. This phase ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.

##Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Follows a linear, sequential structure where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. Once a phase is finished, it is usually difficult to go back .It is great for simple programs.
Agile: Emphasizes an iterative and incremental approach. Projects are broken down into small cycles called "sprints," allowing teams to develop, test, and refine the product in shorter intervals.It is great for complex software that require a lot of user feedback.

##Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to build functional software applications according to specifications.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures the software meets quality standards by designing and executing test plans, identifying bugs, and verifying that all requirements are met.

Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the project, coordinating team activities, managing timelines, and ensuring the project aligns with business objectives and stays within budget.

##Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: IDEs streamline the coding process by providing a unified interface with tools like code editors, debuggers, and build automation, which enhance productivity, help prevent errors, and make code easier to develop, test, and maintain.For example VS code

VCS: Version Control Systems allow developers to track and manage changes to the codebase, collaborate seamlessly across teams, and roll back to previous versions if issues arise, which promotes stability, teamwork, and a clear project history.For example GIT.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complex Codebases: As applications grow, navigating and understanding large codebases becomes challenging.

Strategy: Use modular design principles, break down the code into well-documented, reusable components, and follow consistent coding standards to improve code readability and maintainability.
Keeping Up with Rapid Technology Changes: Software engineering involves constant learning as new tools, languages, and frameworks emerge.

Strategy: Dedicate time for continuous learning, follow industry blogs and attend training sessions, and engage in coding communities to stay updated with new technologies and best practices.
Balancing Development Speed with Quality: Meeting tight deadlines while maintaining high-quality standards can be difficult.

Strategy: Use agile methodologies to prioritize features, implement automated testing to catch issues early, and practice code reviews to ensure quality without sacrificing speed.

##Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected. It’s important for identifying bugs at the earliest stage, improving code reliability and simplifying debugging.

Integration Testing: Focuses on verifying the interaction between integrated components or modules. It’s crucial for detecting interface defects and ensuring that different parts of the application work well together.

System Testing: Examines the entire system as a whole to validate that it meets specified requirements. This testing type is important for identifying system-wide issues and ensuring the software functions as a complete product.

Acceptance Testing: Conducted to confirm the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release. This final testing stage is essential for ensuring customer satisfaction and verifying that the software performs in real-world scenarios.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


##Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise, contextually relevant input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and useful responses. 
it's importance in interacting with AI models include:
Improved Accuracy: Well-constructed prompts help reduce ambiguity, enabling the AI to understand and respond accurately to complex queries or nuanced questions.

Customization and Control: Prompt engineering allows users to guide the AI’s tone, detail level, or style, making responses more relevant and aligned with the desired output, whether it’s for casual use, professional tasks, or technical explanations.

Efficiency and Productivity: By fine-tuning prompts, users can get more relevant answers with fewer iterations, saving time and increasing productivity, especially in research, content creation, and technical assistance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: write code to show missing file.
Improved code: Write code in python to show whether a file is missing. It should allow the user to input the name of the file. It should then run a search algorithm to detemine if the file exists. lastly it should give feedback, in for of text to the user if the file is not found.
The improved file specifies the language to be used and gives a clear guidline of activities to be followed by the AI model.
